My personal dev setup backpack, because I got tired of copy-pasting install commands from docs all the time.

## 📝 Why?

Every package has its own install and config steps.  
Every time I start a new project, I find myself googling “prettier install”, scrolling to the docs, and copy-pasting the same lines.

## 📦 Usage

Show available command:

```bash
npx ransel help
```

Install and configure prettier:

```bash
npx ransel prettier
```

More command coming soon ✨
